MINES20 by Fabrizio Caruso

Original game idea by Fabrizio Caruso

This is strategy game. Move carefully.
You are in a minefield where mines appear both
- under your feet once you move and 
- around you (more if you do not move)
You can clear the area around you with anti-mine charges but you can only carry a maximum of 9.
If you reach a "$" item you get an extra anti-mine charge.
The field has upper and lower borders that kill you if reached. Left and Right border wrap around.
The rate of mines appearing around you, increases continuously.

Goals:
- Reach the highest score possible by walking on empty positions or collecting charges "$"
- Avoid stepping on mines or the upper and lower borders. 
- Reach the next 100 points to get a full recharge of your anti-mine charges

SCORE:
- Walk into an empty position: 1 point
- Walk into a anti-mine charge "$": 5 points

CONTROLS:
- Use I J K L to move 
- Use SPACE to clear nearby area (if you have enough charges)

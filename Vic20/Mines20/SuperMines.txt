SUPER MINES RULES

Avoid the walls and the mines or destroy the mines by using the anti-mine charges $ or the special items ("clubs" and "hearts").

EVEN POSITIONS
Mines are produced ONLY at nearly "EVEN" positions with respect to the player + at the player's previous position, i.e.
The following diagram describes what we mean by "EVEN" positions:
o-o-o-o-o
---------
o-o-P-o-o
---------
o-o-o-o-o

Remark: Advanced player can use this information to avoid the formation of mines that could block a path or remove a good item.

At each step:
1. the mine at the player's position is ALWAYS produced and 
2. possibly an additional mine is produced at an "EVEN" position

ANTI-MINE CHARGES
The player can destroy up to 4 mines by using an anti-mine charge $ which destroys mines on top, botton, right and left of the player.
Charges are scarse and the player can only keep a maximum of 9.
Charges can be collected on the game area or can be totally restore by reaching the next 100 points.

SPECIAL ITEMS
The two special items will free some areas when reached:
1. "clubs" destroys anything around it position
2. "hearts" destroys a small local area a lots of position on all the area (about an 8th of the current game area)

WALLS
Walls will shrink after some number of steps. This makes the game more challenging.

SCORE
1. step on empty area: 1 point
2. step on a charge $: 5 points
3. step on the "clubs" item: 15 points
4. step on the "hearts" item: 20 points

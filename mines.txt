MINES by Fabrizio Caruso

Setting:
You are in a minefield where mines appear 
- under your feet once you move and 
- around you (more if you do not move)
You can clear the area around you with some special charges "$" but you can only carry max 5 at the time.
Some charges will appear at random positions on the screen.
The field has upper and lower borders kill you if reached. Left and Right border wrap arround (as text on the screen).

Points:
- Walk into an empty position: 1 point
- Walk into a charge "$": 5 points

Goals:
- Reach the highest score possible by walking on empty positions or collecting charges "$"
- Avoid stepping on mines or the upper and lower borders. 

Controls:
- Use I J K L to move 
- Use SPACE to clear nearby area (if you have enough charges)

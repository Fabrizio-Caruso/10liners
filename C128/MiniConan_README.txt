This game is an original text role game by Fabrizio Caruso.
The game concept was inspired by Conan (aka Avventura):

- The setting
You are Conan, an adventurer who goes on quests to recover treasures and slaughter enemies.

- The Inn
The Inn is your base from which you can choose to go on, either on one of 3 quests or go to the merchant to buy some of its items.

- Conan's abilities

-- Energy
Conan's life level is given by the his energy.
When below zero, he is dead.

-- Power and Speed
Conan (as well as the enemies) has 2 main abilities:
1. power (used in attacks): it increase by fighting and by completing quests
2. speed (used when fleeing enemies): it increases by succeding escapes and completing quests


- The Merchant
The merchant sells 3 types of items:
1. Potion (+10 energy, consumed immediately)
2. Boots (+10 boot level, consumed when escaping from enemy encounters): Each upgrade provides safety in the next 10 escpape attempts
3. Armor: (+1 armor level, never consumed): It provides a dammage reduction factor both when you fight and when you fail an escape

Remark: There is a constant supply of potions when your return from a quest. Boots and armor upgrades are never replenished.

- Enemies
1. Trolls (fast and weak)
2. Orcs (slow and strong)
3. Elves (very fast and average strong)
4. Werewolves (very strong and average fast)

- The Quests
1. Eerie Forest (only trolls and orcs here)
2. Cave (only trolls, orcs and elves here)
3. Dark Woods (trolls, orcss, elves amd werewolves here)


- Enemies fights
When you fight, you lose an ammount of energy that depends:
- the enemy strenght
- the number of enemies (quadratically)
- a constant random factor
- your armor
A fight ends with dead enemies. You may also die if your energy is below zero.

- Escapes
When you try an escape you may succed or fail.
When you fail you get a penalty that depends on:
- the enemy speed
- the number of enemies (quadratically)
- a constant random factor
The lost points are significantly fewer than in a fight.
After you fail you can decide to try an escpae or attack.
If you have a positive boots level, your escape will always succed with no lost points but your boot level decreases by 1.


- Game progression
The number of enemies will slowly increaes in all 3 quests

- Strategy
Simple initial strategy is to attack weak enemies and escape from strong and weak enemies.
As your abilities increase, you will be able to fight against stronger enemies and run away from faster enemies.

- Game's end
The game has no ending other than your death!
You will get an increasing number of enemies in your fights and your abilities will increase as long as you survive fights and escapes.
